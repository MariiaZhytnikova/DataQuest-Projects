# DataQuest-Projects
It is repository of projects from DataQuest Python cource

First project is the analysis of the dataset of helicopter prison escapes!

By means of Data Analysis we will answer the following questions:
    - In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
    - In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
    - In which countries do helicopter prison breaks have a higher chance of success?
    - How does the number of escapees affect the success?
    - Which escapees have done it more than once?
